## 🚀 Welcome to Intellosync Docs

This guide will help you get started with managing and publishing your documentation using the Intellosync platform powered by Mintlify.

---

## ⚙️ Set Up Your Local Environment

Learn how to manage your documentation locally and deploy updates effortlessly.

### 🛠️ Edit and Preview Your Docs

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone Your Docs Repository">
    During onboarding, we set up a GitHub repository containing your documentation. 
    You can find this on your [Intellosync dashboard](https://dashboard.intellosync.com). 
    
    To clone the repository:
    - Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    - Follow [GitHub’s cloning guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) if you need more help.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview Your Changes Locally">
    To make sure everything looks perfect before going live:

    1. Install the Mintlify CLI:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mintlify
    ```

    2. From your docs root (where `docs.json` is):
    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```

    <Note>
      🚨 If you're still using the old `mint.json` format:

      ```bash
      npm i -g mintlify@latest
      mintlify upgrade
      ```

      ✅ You’re now using the latest `docs.json`. You can remove `mint.json`.
    </Note>

## 🚢 Deploy Your Documentation

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install the Intellosync GitHub App">
    Our GitHub app handles automatic deployments. 
    - Head over to the [Intellosync dashboard](https://dashboard.intellosync.com).
    - Click **Install GitHub App**.
    - Once installed, each commit will show a ✔️ if deployed successfully.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push Changes to Deploy">
    To publish updates:
    1. Commit and push your changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update docs"
    git push origin main
    ```

    2. Watch for the deployment status from our GitHub app.

    <Note>
      🧠 If the deployment doesn’t trigger, you can manually deploy from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.intellosync.com).
